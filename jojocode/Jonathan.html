<h2>Jonathan Joestar</h2>

<section>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Jonathan Joestar first appears in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood. Which takes place in the 1800s. While he is not the first JoJo in his lineage he is first protagonist in the series. </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Strengths</h3>
    <p>Jonathan is the original protagonist of the Jojo's Bizarre Aventure Series. Without him there would be no show. His run in the series sets the "Bizarre" tone for the series.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
    <p>Jonathan has the shortest story arc in the entire series. He is also a one dimestional character who lives by an unattainably high moral code. This makes him a less interesting character as he does not encounter any kind of moral dilemma over his choices.</p>
