<section>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Jotaro Cujoh makes his first apperance in part 3 of the series. In this part they introduce "stands" for the first time which is an astral projection of the users fighting spirit. This creative direction by Hirohiko Araki helped significantly boost the series popularity. Jotaro Cujoh's character is modeled after the famous Hollywood actor "Clint Eastwood". Showcaseing a no nonsense personality and having the iconic phrase "Good grief" (やれやれだぜ, yare yare daze). Makes him a the most favored protagonist among fans. </p>

<section>
  <h3>Strengths</h3>
  <p>Jotaro's story arc is not only the fisrt to have Stands. It also features an ensemble of characters that embark on a perilous journey together, higher stakes involved and a full feeling that this show is really Bizzare!<p>
</section>
<section>
   <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
   <p>While Jotaro,the character himself, does not posseses many weaknesses in a writing sense. The story arc in part 3 goes on just alittle too long with a "villian of the week" formula that is used too much. It is also not advisable to skip part 1 and 2 before watching part 3 as much of the story and characters come from the events of the previous two parts.</p>
